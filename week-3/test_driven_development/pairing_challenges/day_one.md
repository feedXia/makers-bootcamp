# Project: The day one pairing challenges

To achieve these goals:
  >"I'm a great pair programmer"

## Action Plan
  - Find your pair
  - Agree when you'll swap over driver/navigator
  - Set a timer for that long
  - [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/week-1/pairing_challenges)

## Evidence Plan
  - Ask my pair the following:
      - Did we stick to the agreement we made at the start? If not, how come? (perhaps it was for a good reason!)
      - What was the best part?
      - What's the one thing I could do to improve?
  - Offer to answer the same questions for them
