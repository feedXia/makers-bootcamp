# Calculator Exercise

- [x] **Use a diagram to group** the methods in this example:

```ruby
class Calculator
  def add(number_1, number_2)
    number_1 + number_2
  end

  def subtract(number_1, number_2)
    number_1 - number_2
  end

  def print_answer(answer)
    "The Answer is: #{ answer }"
  end
end
```

- [x] **Refactor** the methods in the Calculator example into two classes as you see fit.
