# Bank Account

_Makers Bootcamp Week 3 Test Driven Development Key Skills Exercise_

This project applied my test driven development learnings to build a single BankAccount object based on the following user stories: 

```
As a customer,
So that I can keep my money safe,
I would like to deposit money in my account

As a customer,
So that I can spend my money,
I would like to withdraw money from my account

As a customer,
So that I can budget,
I would like to view my balance
```
