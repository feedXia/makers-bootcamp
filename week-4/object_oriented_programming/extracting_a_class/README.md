## Extracting classes

**Learning Objectives:**
 - Know how to annotate code
 - Spot indicators for similar behaviour in a class
 - Extract a class to follow the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

**Exercise:**
1. Print out the code in `exercise/lib/car.rb`

2. Diagram the current domain

3. Annotate each line of the printout with the operations that are happening
   - describe the code in English as if to someone who is not familiar with code.

4. list all the
  - groupings of things doing similar things
  - data that is being stored in memory/changed

5. Using this information try to write a sentence explaining what exactly this class knows about.

6. Diagram a domain that demonstrates a better design

7. Out of your list choose one at a time and start to move logic out of `car.rb`, test-driven.
