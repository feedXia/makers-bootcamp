# Secret Diary Challenge

Test-drive the secret diary example.
Use TDD and the red-green-refactor process.

```
SecretDiary
  - lock
  - unlock
  - add_entry
  - get_entries

Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.

When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.

When the user locks the diary, by calling `lock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should, again, throw an error.
```

## Project To Do's

```
